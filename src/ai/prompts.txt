Step 1:
 
I have a problem related to {input}. Could you brainstorm three distinct solutions? Please consider a variety of factors such as {perfect_factors}
A:

Step 2:

For each of the three proposed solutions, evaluate their potential. Consider their pros and cons, initial effort needed, implementation difficulty, potential challenges, and the expected outcomes. Assign a probability of success and a confidence level to each option based on these factors

{solutions}

A:

Step 3:

For each solution, deepen the thought process. Generate potential scenarios, strategies for implementation, any necessary partnerships or resources, and how potential obstacles might be overcome. Also, consider any potential unexpected outcomes and how they might be handled.

I’m going to ask you a question. I want you to decompose it into a series of subquestions. Each subquestion should be self-contained with all the information necessary to solve it.

Make sure not to decompose more than necessary or have any trivial subquestions - you’ll be evaluated on the simplicity, conciseness, and correctness of your decompositions as well as your final answer. You should wrap each subquestion in <sub q></sub q> tags. After each subquestion, you should answer the subquestion and put your subanswer in <sub a></sub a> tags.

 Once you have all the information you need to answer the question, output <FIN></FIN> tags.

example:
Question: What is Bitcoin?
<sub q>What is the purpose of Bitcoin?</sub q>
<sub a>Bitcoin serves as a decentralized digital currency.</sub a>
<sub q>What does decentralized mean?</sub q>
<sub a>Decentralized means it operates without a central authority or single administrator.</sub a>
<FIN>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates without a central authority.</FIN>

Question: {question}
